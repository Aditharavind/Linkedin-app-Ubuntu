## LinkedIn Linux Desktop Application

### Description
This repository contains the standalone LinkedIn Linux desktop application, packaged as an **AppImage** for easy distribution and usage across various Linux distributions. The application allows you to interact with LinkedIn directly from your desktop without needing to open a browser.

### Features:
- **Standalone application**: No need for installation. Just download and run.
- **Cross-distro support**: Works on most Linux distributions that support AppImage.
- **No dependencies**: Bundles all necessary libraries to run LinkedIn smoothly.
  
### Installation

#### **Using AppImage (Recommended)**

1. **Download the AppImage** from the [releases page](#). You can download it from the repository's release section.
   
2. **Make the AppImage executable**:

   Open a terminal and navigate to the folder where the AppImage is located. For example:

   ```bash
   cd ~/Downloads
   ```

   Run the following command to make the AppImage executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x LinkedIn-linux-x64.AppImage
   ```

3. **Run the AppImage**:

   Now, you can run the LinkedIn desktop application directly:

   ```bash
   ./LinkedIn-linux-x64.AppImage
   ```

#### **Using Snap (Alternative)**

For those who prefer using Snap for easy management and installation:

1. Install Snapcraft if you don’t already have it:

   sudo apt install snapcraft
   ```

2. Build the Snap package from the source and install it (if available). This option is for users who prefer Snap integration and updates.

#### **Using .deb Package (For Debian-based systems)**
